# Overview

I am writing this simple tip for anyone who wants to create their curriculum vitae using [Latex](https://www.latex-project.org).

<strong>Latex</strong> is used to write scientific articles is commonly used in academic because of its ease in writing mathematical expressions and also generates a better impression of exports to PDF and fonts. There is a program that I like to use that makes it much easier to write your documents in Latex and it's name is [LyX](https://www.lyx.org). To use <strong>LyX</strong> simply search the repository of your Linux distribution or go directly to the site and dowload.

## 1. Installing

As the purpose is to create a CV, there is a ready-made Latex package <strong>moderncv</strong> that you can download and install here: [https://ctan.org/pkg/moderncv](https://ctan.org/pkg/moderncv) 

If you need more packages it is good to look for [CTAN](https://ctan.org/pkg) to download and install on your machine.

With <strong>LyX</strong> installed, open the terminal on your computer and install the <strong>moderncv</strong>:

{%highlight bash%}
cd /usr/share/texmf/tex/latex
mv ~/moderncv.zip && unzip moderncv.zip && rm moderncv.zip
mktexlsr && texhash
lyx -x reconfigure
{%endhighlight%}

Now download the cv template:

{%highlight bash%}
git clone https://github.com/edersoncorbari/cv-latex-template.git
{%endhighlight%}

### 1.1 Start 

Open <strong>LyX</strong> and look for the file (cv_en_ecorbari.lyx) make all necessary changes, rename the files to your preference, if a package is missing in [CTAN](https://ctan.org/pkg) and do the same procedure used in mordercv. With <strong>LyX</strong> open click (Tools -> Reconfigure) to reconfigure the document.

![Screen LyX 1]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/blog/lyx-cv1.png)
{: .align-center}

Click the document properties to make the main changes:

![Screen LyX 2]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/blog/lyx-cv2.png)
{: .align-center}

Exporting to PDF (pdflatex):

![Screen LyX 3]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/blog/lyx-cv3.png)
{: .align-center}

PDF file generated:

![Screen LyX 4]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/blog/lyx-cv4.png)
{: .align-center}

Bless you!
