<h2>Making adjustments</h2>

<p>I usually make small optimizations on FreeBSD, even using it as a desktop. I like to modify the network 
part and recompile the kernel with the options I'm going to use.</p>

<p>Basically copy and put the configuration files below. Getting stuck to your network NIC which may be 
of another model.
</p>

<h3>1. Modifying the /boot/loader.conf</h3>

<p>The FreeBSD <b>loader.conf</b> file is called at the boot of the system. The default file is in <b>/boot/defaults/loader.conf</b> 
but we should not change this file, customization should be done in <b>/boot/loader.conf</b>.</p>

<p>Copy and paste the below file:</p>

<pre>
# File: /boot/loader.conf

# Reduce boot-time delay.
autoboot_delay="-1"

# Disable beastie logo.
beastie_disable="YES"

# Intel(R) PRO/1000 Gigabit Ethernet adapter driver, preload.
if_em_load="YES"

# Advanced Host Controller Interface (AHCI).
ahci_load="YES"

# H-TCP Congestion Control for a more aggressive increase in speed on higher
# latency, high bandwidth networks with some packet loss.
cc_htcp_load="YES"

# hostcache cachelimit is the number of ip addresses in the hostcache list.
# Setting the value to zero(0) stops any ip address connection information from
# being cached and negates the need for "net.inet.tcp.hostcache.expire". We
# find disabling the hostcache increases burst data rates by 2x if a subnet was
# incorrectly graded as slow on a previous connection. A host cache entry is
# the client's cached tcp connection details and metrics (TTL, SSTRESH and
# VARTTL) the server can use to improve future performance of connections
# between the same two hosts. When a tcp connection is completed, our server
# will cache information about the connection until an expire timeout. If a new
# connection between the same client is initiated before the cache has expired,
# the connection will use the cached connection details to setup the
# connection's internal variables. This pre-cached setup allows the client and
# server to reach optimal performance significantly faster because the server
# will not need to go through the usual steps of re-learning the optimal
# parameters for the connection. To view the current host cache stats use
# "sysctl net.inet.tcp.hostcache.list"
net.inet.tcp.hostcache.cachelimit="0"

# Change the zfs pool output to show the GPT id for each drive instead of the
# gptid or disk identifier. The gpt id will look like "ada0p2"; the gpt id
# "ada0" of the first drive found on the AHCI SATA / SAS / SCSI chain and
# partition string "p2".  Use "gpart list" to see all drive identifiers and
# "zpool status" to see the chosen id through ZFS.
kern.geom.label.disk_ident.enable="0"
kern.geom.label.gpt.enable="1"
kern.geom.label.gptid.enable="0"

# Interface Maximum Queue Length: common recommendations are to set the interface
# buffer size to the number of packets the interface can transmit (send) in 50
# milliseconds _OR_ 256 packets times the number of interfaces in the machine;
# whichever value is greater. To calculate a size of a 50 millisecond buffer
# for a 60 megabit network take the bandwidth in megabits divided by 8 bits
# divided by the MTU times 50 millisecond times 1000, 60/8/1460*50*1000=256.84
# packets in 50 milliseconds. OR, if the box has two(2) interfaces take 256
# packets times two(2) NICs to equal 512 packets. 512 is greater then 256.84 so
# set to 512.
#
# Our preference is to define the interface queue length as two(2) times the
# value set in the interface transmit descriptor ring, "hw.igb.txd". If
# hw.igb.txd="1024" then set the net.link.ifqmaxlen="2048".
#
# An indirect result of increasing the interface queue is the buffer acts like
# a large TCP initial congestion window (init_cwnd) by allowing a network stack
# to burst packets at the start of a connection. Do not to set to zero(0) or
# the network will stop working due to "no network buffers" available. Do not
# set the interface buffer ludicrously large to avoid buffer bloat.
net.link.ifqmaxlen="2048"  # (default 50)

# Enable the optimized version of soreceive() for stream (TCP) sockets.
# soreceive_stream() only does one sockbuf unlock/lock per receive independent
# of the length of data to be moved into the uio compared to soreceive() which
# unlocks/locks per *mbuf*. soreceive_stream() can significantly reduced CPU
# usage and lock contention when receiving fast TCP streams. Additional gains
# are obtained when the receiving application is using SO_RCVLOWAT to batch up
# some data before a read (and wakeup) is done.
net.inet.tcp.soreceive_stream="1"  # (default 0)
</pre>

<h3>2. Modifying the /etc/rc.conf</h3>

<p>The rc.conf file contains the FreeBSD network startup and services configuration. Make the 
<b>/etc/rc.conf</b> modifications.</p>

<pre>
# RC.conf - System configuration information.

# Machine name.
hostname="orion"

# Network.
ifconfig_em0="DHCP -lro -tso"

# Enable ZFS filesystem.
zfs_enable="YES"

# Disable update motd.
update_motd="NO"

# Clear /tmp on boot.
clear_tmp_enable="YES"

# Allow packets to pass between interfaces.
gateway_enable="YES"

# Keboard delay to 250 ms and repeat to 34 cps.
keyrate="250.34"

# Daemons disabled.
dumpdev="NO"
sendmail_enable="NONE"

# Daemons enabled.
#ntpdate_enable="YES"
#ntpdate_hosts="c.ntp.br"
#ntpd_flags="-g"
sshd_enable="YES"
syslogd_flags="-ss"
</pre>

<h3>3. Modifying the /etc/sysctl.conf</h3>

<p>The <b>sysctl.conf</b> file contains policy customizations for the kernel.</p>

<pre>
# Firewall: Ip Forwarding to allow packets to traverse between interfaces and
# is used for firewalls, bridges and routers. When fast IP forwarding is also
# enabled, IP packets are forwarded directly to the appropriate network
# interface with direct processing to completion, which greatly improves the
# throughput. All packets for local IP addresses, non-unicast, or with IP
# options are handled by the normal IP input processing path. All features of
# the normal (slow) IP forwarding path are supported by fast forwarding
# including firewall (through pfil(9) hooks) checking, except ipsec tunnel
# brokering. The IP fast forwarding path does not generate ICMP redirect or
# source quench messages though. Compared to normal IP forwarding, fast
# forwarding can give a speedup of 40 to 60% in packet forwarding performance
# which is great for interactive connections like online games or VOIP where
# low latency is critical.
net.inet.ip.forwarding=1                   # (default 0)

# H-TCP congestion control: The Hamilton TCP (HighSpeed-TCP) algorithm is a
# packet loss based congestion control and is more aggressive pushing up to max
# bandwidth (total BDP) and favors hosts with lower TTL / VARTTL then the
# default "newreno". Understand "newreno" works well in most conditions and
# enabling HTCP may only gain a you few percentage points of throughput.
# http://www.sigcomm.org/sites/default/files/ccr/papers/2008/July/1384609-1384613.pdf
# make sure to also add 'cc_htcp_load="YES"' to /boot/loader.conf then check
# available congestion control options with "sysctl net.inet.tcp.cc.available"
net.inet.tcp.cc.algorithm=htcp  # (default newreno)

# H-TCP congestion control: adaptive back off will increase bandwidth
# utilization by adjusting the additive-increase/multiplicative-decrease (AIMD)
# backoff parameter according to the amount of buffers available on the path.
# adaptive backoff ensures no queue along the path will remain completely empty
# after a packet loss event which increases buffer efficiency.
net.inet.tcp.cc.htcp.adaptive_backoff=1  # (default 0 ; disabled)

# H-TCP congestion control: RTT scaling will increase the fairness between
# competing TCP flows traversing different RTT paths through a common
# bottleneck. rtt_scaling increases the Congestion Window Size (CWND)
# independent of path round-trip time (RTT) leading to lower latency for
# interactive sessions when the connection is saturated by bulk data transfers.
# Default is 0 (disabled)
net.inet.tcp.cc.htcp.rtt_scaling=1  # (default 0 ; disabled)

# RFC 6675 increases the accuracy of TCP Fast Recovery when combined with
# Selective Acknowledgement (net.inet.tcp.sack.enable=1). TCP loss recovery is
# enhanced by computing "pipe", a sender side estimation of the number of bytes
# still outstanding on the network. Fast Recovery is augmented by sending data
# on each ACK as necessary to prevent "pipe" from falling below the slow-start
# threshold (ssthresh). The TCP window size and SACK-based decisions are still
# determined by the congestion control algorithm; H-TCP if enabled, newreno by
# default.
net.inet.tcp.rfc6675_pipe=1  # (default 0)

# maximum segment size (MSS) specifies the largest payload of data in a single
# IPv4 TCP segment. RFC 6691 states the maximum segment size should equal the
# effective MTU minus the fixed IP and TCP headers, but without subtracting IP
# or TCP options. To construct the MMS, start with the interface MTU of 1500
# bytes and subtract 20 bytes for the IP header and 20 bytes for the TCP header
# to equal 1460 bytes. An MMS of 1460 bytes has a 97% packet efficiency
# (1460/1500=0.97) Note: with net.inet.tcp.rfc1323 enabled, hosts can negotiate
# the tcp timestamps option which reduces the packet payload by 12 bytes and
# the MSS is automatically reduced from 1460 bytes to 1448 bytes total. An MMS
# of 1448 bytes has a 96.5% packet efficiency (1448/1500=0.965) WARNING: if you
# are using PF with an outgoing scrub rule then PF will re-package the packet
# using an MTU of 1460 by default, thus overriding this mssdflt setting and
# possibly wasting CPU time.
net.inet.tcp.mssdflt=1460  # (default 536)

# minimum, maximum segment size (mMSS) specifies the smallest payload of data
# in a single IPv4 TCP segment our system will agree to send when negotiating
# with the client. RFC 6691 states that a minimum MTU frame size of 576 bytes
# must be supported and the MSS option should equal the effective MTU minus the
# fixed IP and TCP headers, but without subtracting IP or TCP options. To
# construct the minimum MMS, start with the minimum recommended MTU size of 576
# bytes and subtract 20 bytes for the IP header and 20 bytes for the TCP header
# to equal 536 bytes. An mMMS of 536 bytes should allow our server to forward
# data across any network without being fragmented and still preserve an
# overhead to data ratio of 93% packet efficiency (536/576=0.93). The default
# mMMS is only 84% efficient (216/256=0.84).
net.inet.tcp.minmss=536  # (default 216)

# Reduce the amount of SYN/ACKs the server will re-transmit to an ip address
# whom did not respond to the first SYN/ACK. On a client's initial connection
# our server will always send a SYN/ACK in response to the client's initial
# SYN. Limiting retranstited SYN/ACKS reduces local syn cache size and a "SYN
# flood" DoS attack's collateral damage by not sending SYN/ACKs back to spoofed
# ips, multiple times. If we do continue to send SYN/ACKs to spoofed IPs they
# may send RST's back to us and an "amplification" attack would begin against
# our host. If you do not wish to send retransmits at all then set to zero(0)
# especially if you are under a SYN attack. If our first SYN/ACK gets dropped
# the client will re-send another SYN if they still want to connect. Also set
# "net.inet.tcp.msl" to two(2) times the average round trip time of a client,
# but no lower then 2000ms (2s). Test with "netstat -s -p tcp" and look under
# syncache entries. http://www.ouah.org/spank.txt
# http://people.freebsd.org/~jlemon/papers/syncache.pdf
net.inet.tcp.syncache.rexmtlimit=0  # (default 3)

# IP fragments require CPU processing time and system memory to reassemble. Due
# to multiple attacks vectors ip fragmentation can contribute to and that
# fragmentation can be used to evade packet inspection and auditing, we will
# not accept ipv4 fragments. Comment out these directives when supporting
# traffic which generates fragments by design; like NFS and certain
# preternatural functions of the Sony PS4.
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_fragmentation_attack
net.inet.ip.maxfragpackets=0     # (default 13687)
net.inet.ip.maxfragsperpacket=0  # (default 16)

# TCP Slow start gradually increases the data send rate until the TCP
# congestion algorithm (HTCP) calculates the networks maximum carrying capacity
# without dropping packets. TCP Congestion Control with Appropriate Byte
# Counting (ABC) allows our server to increase the maximum congestion window
# exponentially by the amount of data ACKed, but limits the maximum increment
# per ACK to (abc_l_var * maxseg) bytes. An abc_l_var of 44 times a maxseg of
# 1460 bytes would allow slow start to increase the congestion window by more
# than 64 kilobytes per step; 65535 bytes is the TCP receive buffer size of
# most hosts without TCP window scaling.
net.inet.tcp.abc_l_var=44  # (default 2)

# Initial Congestion Window (initcwnd) limits the amount of segments that TCP
# can send onto the network before receiving an ACK from the other machine.
# Increasing the TCP Initial Congestion Window will reduce data transfer
# latency during the slow start phase of a TCP connection. The initial
# congestion window should be increased to speed up short, burst connections
# in order to send the most data in the shortest time frame without overloading
# any network buffers. Google's study reported sixteen(16) segments as showing
# the lowest latency initial congestion window. Also test 44 segments which is
# 65535 bytes, the TCP receive buffer size of most hosts without TCP window
# scaling. https://developers.google.com/speed/articles/tcp_initcwnd_paper.pdf
net.inet.tcp.initcwnd_segments=44             # (default 10 for FreeBSD 11.0)
#net.inet.tcp.experimental.initcwnd10=1       # (default  1 for FreeBSD 10.1)
#net.inet.tcp.experimental.initcwnd10=1       # (default  0 for FreeBSD  9.2)
#net.inet.tcp.local_slowstart_flightsize=44   # (default  4 for FreeBSD  9.1)
#net.inet.tcp.slowstart_flightsize=44         # (default  4 for FreeBSD  9.1)

# TCP Receive Window: The throughput of connection is limited by two windows: the
# (Initial) Congestion Window and the TCP Receive Window (wsize). The Congestion
# Window avoids exceeding the capacity of the network (H-TCP congestion
# control); and the Receive Window avoids exceeding the capacity of the
# receiver to process data (flow control). When our server is able to process
# packets as fast as they are received we want to allow the remote sending
# host to send data as fast as the network, Congestion Window, will allow.
# Increase the Window Scaling Factor (wsize) to fourteen(14) which allows the
# our server to receive 2^14 x 65,535 bytes = 1,064,960 bytes (100 gigabit) on
# the network before requiring an ACK packet.
#
# maxsockbuf:   2MB  wsize:  6  2^ 6*65KB =    4MB (FreeBSD default)
# maxsockbuf: 600MB  wsize: 14  2^14*65KB = 1064MB
kern.ipc.maxsockbuf=614400000  # (wsize 14)

# Syncookies have advantages and disadvantages. Syncookies are useful if you
# are being DoS attacked as this method helps filter the proper clients from
# the attack machines. But, since the TCP options from the initial SYN are not
# saved in syncookies, the tcp options are not applied to the connection,
# precluding use of features like window scale, timestamps, or exact MSS
# sizing. As the returning ACK establishes the connection, it may be possible
# for an attacker to ACK flood a machine in an attempt to create a connection.
# Another benefit to overflowing to the point of getting a valid SYN cookie is
# the attacker can include data payload. Now that the attacker can send data to
# a FreeBSD network daemon, even using a spoofed source IP address, they can
# have FreeBSD do processing on the data which is not something the attacker
# could do without having SYN cookies. Even though syncookies are helpful
# during a DoS, we are going to disable syncookies at this time.
net.inet.tcp.syncookies=0  # (default 1)

# TCP segmentation offload (TSO), also called large segment offload (LSO),
# should be disabled on NAT firewalls and routers. TSO/LSO works by queuing up
# large buffers and letting the network interface card (NIC) split them into
# separate packets. The problem is the NIC can build a packet that is the wrong
# size and would be dropped by a switch or the receiving machine, like for NFS
# fragmented traffic. If the packet is dropped the overall sending bandwidth is
# reduced significantly. You can also disable TSO in /etc/rc.conf using the
# "-tso" directive after the network card configuration; for example,
# ifconfig_igb0="inet 10.10.10.1 netmask 255.255.255.0 -tso". Verify TSO is off
# on the hardware by making sure TSO4 and TSO6 are not seen in the "options="
# section using ifconfig.
# http://www.peerwisdom.org/2013/04/03/large-send-offload-and-network-performance/
net.inet.tcp.tso=0  # (default 1)

# Fortuna pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) maximum event size is also
# referred to as the minimum pool size. Fortuna has a main generator which
# supplies the OS with PRNG data. The Fortuna generator is seeded by 32
# separate 'Fortuna' accumulation pools which each have to be filled with at
# least 'minpoolsize' bytes before being able to seed the generator. On
# FreeBSD, the default 'minpoolsize' of 64 bytes is an estimate of how many
# bytes a new pool should contain to provide at least 128 bits of entropy.
# After a pool is used in a generator reseed, it is reset to an empty string
# and must reach 'minpoolsize' bytes again before being used as a seed. By
# increasing the 'minpoolsize' we allow higher entropy into the accumulation
# pools before being assimilated by the generator. 256 bytes will provide an
# absolute minimum of 512 bits of entropy, but realistically closer to 2048
# bits of entropy, for each of the 32 accumulation pools. Values between 64
# bytes and 256 bytes are reasonable, but higher values like 1024 bytes are
# also acceptable when coupled with a dedicated hardware based PRNG like the
# fast source Intel Secure Key RNG.
kern.random.fortuna.minpoolsize=2048  # (default 64)

# Initial Sequence Numbers (ISN) refer to the unique 32-bit sequence number
# assigned to each new Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connection. The TCP
# protocol assigns an ISN to each new byte, beginning with 0 and incrementally
# adding a secret number every four seconds until the limit is exhausted. In
# continuous communication all available ISN options could be used up in a few
# hours. Normally a new secret number is only chosen after the ISN limit has
# been exceeded. In order to defend against Sequence Number Attacks the ISN
# secret key should not be used sufficiently often that it would be regarded as
# insecure or predictable. Reseeding will break TIME_WAIT recycling for a few
# minutes. BUT, for the more paranoid, simply choose a random number of seconds
# in which a new ISN secret should be generated.

<h3>4. Compiling the kernel</h3>

<p>To build the kernel in FreeBSD is very simple, everything is done in a single file, however there are a number of 
possible configurations and depends on your hardware. But to build just run the commands below:</p>

<pre>
cp /usr/src/sys/amd64/conf/GENERIC /usr/src/sys/amd64/conf/ORION
vi /usr/src/sys/amd64/conf/ORION
</pre>

<p>Try checking the devices you do not use and comment or remove the line from the kernel configuration file. Below 
is my kernel file, I removed sound card, network card that I do not use for this hardware.<p>
