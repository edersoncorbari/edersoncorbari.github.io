Guys, I'm going to start writing my technical experiments on **Medium**, whenever I have some spare time, obviously! But please access here and follow me [ https://medium.com/@ecorbari](https://medium.com/@ecorbari). It's much easier to maintain, and the usability on mobile phones and tablets is much better, leading to more engagement from people.

Get into the vibe of this song I'm listening to right now:

        <iframe width="400" height="400" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/NaaXFSKFtAY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    </figure>
</div>

Stay **strong** and **positive**!

Cheers,
EDMC.
