# Overview 

We all know that in the last few years the position of data engineer is high on the market, together
with data science. 

However we can still observe in the market, a certain discrepancy in the technical profile
of the data engineer. I'm talking about this point specifically for the Latin American region, maybe elsewhere around
in the rest of the world this is more advanced.

Companies have difficulty hiring and mapping profiles properly, especially consulting companies, and often end up generalizing 
the profile of the vacancy, announcing the vacancy simply (Data Engineer). 

They even end up with people who are (relational database) used to solving problems with SQL for projects where you need a 
programming skill (coding), or sometimes a more data analysis profile.

It happens! We have different data engineer profiles, basically I thought of 3, I will detail the following types.

## 1. Analytical Skill

This engineer has a more analytical skill, usually people with training in the fields of: Computer Science, Mathematics, Physics.

This engineer is responsible for scaling Machine Learning models and productization these models. He has relevant knowledge in the area 
of Data Science and knows how to (coding) very well.

This engineer knows the sklearn, tensorflow, keras, this professional adapts the model of the Data Scientists defines
the design patterns and makes this model run in production for millions of users to use. I think that
the most difficult profile to find currently.

### 1.1 Skills:

 * Distributed ML Platforms: MLib (Spark), Mahout (Hadoop), AWS SageMaker;
 * Algorithms and data structure: union, linked list, trees, graphs;
 * Parallel Computing for Deep Learning (Tensorflow, GPU Programming);
 * Development in Containers (Docker, Rkt);
 * Programming in Notebooks (Zeppelin, Jupyter).

## 2. Builder Skill

This engineer has a profile focused on the monitoring of resources, provisioning, pipeline, volumetry, this professional
knows how to raise a cluster from scratch, knows the solutions of APIs/Libs and has domain of them. 

Generally, this professional has training in (information system, project management). Does the hard work of saving terabytes 
of data and leaving the collection services in place. 

### 2.1 Skills:

 * Cloud Storage Services (AWS S3, Google FS, BigQuery, Redshift);
 * Streaming Platforms (Kafka, Kinesis, Storm);
 * Management of VMs (EC2, GCC);
 * Container Orchestration (Kubernetes, AWS Fargate, Mesos);
 * Provisioning and Monitoring Tools (TerraForm, New Relic, ELK);
 * Maintenance of Distributed DataStores (ElasticSearch, Mongo Clusters / MySQL / Oracle / PostgreSQL).

## 3. Developer (Code)

This engineer is a specialist in developing Big Data, batch or real-time applications. 

Has a great knowledge of Software Architecture, standards and programming languages, usually this professional 
has moved from the software development area to the Big Data area. They have a background in Computer Science 
and Information Systems.

### 3.1 Skills:

 * Programming in Java, C++ and / or Go and Functional languages (Scala, Clojure, Elixir);
 * Paradigms of distributed programming (Channels, Actors);
 * SQL and NoSQL Interfaces (KQL, ElasticSearch API);
 * Webservices;
 * ETL APIs / Platforms (Spark, Airflow, Luigi, Nifi).

## Conclusion 

That's the 3 main profiles, of course there are always exceptions to the rules. The data engineering area is relatively new, 
but that's a perception I see in the marketplace where I work. In the case of consulting companies it is common to see a 
professional with analytical skill, performing the task of a builder profile and vice versa.
