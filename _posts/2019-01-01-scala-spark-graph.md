# Overview

This article was also published on the site: [https://dzone.com/articles/bigdata-developing-a-graph-in-spark-and-scala](https://dzone.com/articles/bigdata-developing-a-graph-in-spark-and-scala).

Recently in my work I needed to create a solution using graph to create a hierarchy of relationship between employees of the company. 
This is a simple problem, but I had never done it in the BigData area and using [Apache Graphx](https://spark.apache.org/graphx/).

In this case we were using [Cloudera's](https://www.cloudera.com) cluster environment that commercial environment, but the solution works the same way for the open-source versions.

For anyone interested in Cloudera solutions to study Big-Data you can [download](https://www.cloudera.com/downloads/quickstart_vms/5-13.html) the virtual machine with a cluster configured and ready to use.

## 1. The problem

We need to ingest the employee data that was in the relational database <strong>Oracle</strong> for the cluster, do some data processing, and save it in <strong>Hive</strong>, but we did not have the relationships to create a hierarchy between the employee levels, so we used a table with auxiliary data and created a graph top-down to create the relationships.

<strong>Detail:</strong> Relational databases such as Oracle have the [CONNECT BY](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B19306_01/server.102/b14200/queries003.htm) function that works with the Hierarchy.

Below I did a hypothetical design of the employee hierarchy that has 9 levels:

![Screen Employee Hierarchy]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/blog/employee-hierarchy.png)
{: .align-center}

Graphx (pregel) has two types of graphs that are Top-Down and Bottom-Up, in which case it would be a modeling using Top-Down:

![Screen Graph Top Down and Button]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/blog/graph-top-down-bottom-up.png)
{: .align-center}

### 1.1 Start 

After several transformations of the data, we arrive at a DataFrame similar to this one:

| Level   |      Role         |  Name            | Connect By |
|:-------:|:-----------------:|:----------------:|:----------:|
| 1       |  PRESIDENT        | Tim Cox          | null       |
| 2       |  VP               | Robert Watson    | 1          |
| 3       |  VP               | Matthew Powers   | 1          |
| 4       |  VP               | Alex Pess        | 1          |
| 5       |  DIRECTOR         | Jo√£o Bastos      | 2          |
| 6       |  DIRECTOR         | Martin Jay       | 3          |
| 7       |  SUPERVISOR       | Ana Becker       | 5          |
| 8       |  SUPERVISOR       | Marcos Silverio  | 6          |
| 9       |  MANAGER          | Carlos Klaus     | 8          |
| 10      |  ANALYST          | Jacob Oliver     | 9          |
| 11      |  ANALYST          | Charlie Noah     | 9          |
| 12      |  ANALYST          | Claudio Stwart   | 9          |
| 13      |  SENIOR DEVELOPER | Jack Connor      | 10         |
| 14      |  SENIOR DEVELOPER | Daniel Mason     | 10         |
| 15      |  JUNIOR DEVELOPER | George Reece     | 13         |

But this is only an example for our test, using the diagram above the hierarchy. The data containing <strong>null</strong> is considered the <strong>root</strong> of the 
relationship, in the case it would be a President or CEO of the company.

### 1.2 Analyzing the result 

Creating a DataFrame with the above data for tests:

{%highlight scala%}
val empDF = sparkSession.sparkContext.parallelize(Array(
  ("1", "Tim Cox", "PRESIDENT", null.asInstanceOf[String]),
  ("2", "Robert Watson", "VP", "1"),
  ("3", "Matthew Powers", "VP", "1"),
  ("4", "Alex Pess", "VP", "1"),
  ("5", "Joao Bastos", "DIRECTOR", "2"),
  ("6", "Martin Jay", "DIRECTOR", "3"),
  ("7", "Anna Becker", "SUPERVISOR", "5"),
  ("8", "Marcos Silverio", "SUPERVISOR", "6"),
  ("9", "Carlos Klaus", "MANAGER", "8"),
  ("10", "Jacob Oliver", "ANALYST", "9"),
  ("11", "Charlie Noah", "ANALYST", "9"),
  ("12", "Claudio Stwart", "ANALYST", "9"),
  ("13", "Jack Connor", "SENIOR DEVELOPER", "10"),
  ("14", "Daniel Mason", "SENIOR DEVELOPER", "10"),
  ("15", "George Reece", "JUNIOR DEVELOPER", "13")))
  .toDF("id", "name", "role", "id_connect_by")
{%endhighlight%}

After running that DataFrame in the graph, you will get the following result:

{%highlight scala%}
