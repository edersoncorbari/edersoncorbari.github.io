## Misc facts

* My **first programming language** was *C*, and my first programming book was [C - programming language](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-2nd-Brian-Kernighan/dp/0131103628). 
* My first computer was an IBM *RS/6000* model [M20](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RS/6000) running Unix [AIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_AIX).
* I'm **passionate** about programming and software development since it allows me to use my brain in order to solve puzzles, and gives me a power to create something from a scratch with my own-defined logic.
* I also like Unix-type operating systems. I use [FreeBSD](https://www.freebsd.org/), [Slackware](http://www.slackware.com) and [OpenSUSE](https://www.opensuse.org)  as a workstation.
* I really like sitcon friends and wrote something about it here: [Friends](https://edersoncorbari.github.io/friends/).

## This site

In the beginning the main reason I created this site was to document tips and tricks that I learned through my daily work. Very soon, however, I discovered that framing my posts in a form of a tutorial is much more suitable.

**Note:** this site theme was shamelessly forked from an awesome Jekyll theme [minimal-mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/) by [Michael Rose](https://mademistakes.com/).
