I created this program a long time ago, it was created using **FreeBSD** version 2.0 and using the **GCC** compiler, 
later improvements and adaptations were made to the code to continue compiling. In 2005 I decided to publish in the 
FreeBSD ports system.

It is a system that monitors the serial port of the UPS to know when the power is gone or came back, it was created using 
the **C** language and using **ShellScript** to run the shutdown or reboot command.
