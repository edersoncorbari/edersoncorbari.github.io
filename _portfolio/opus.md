OPUS (Unified System of the Works Process) is a decision support system that aims to support the planning, programming, monitoring, supervision, 
management and execution functions of Engineering works and services. It supports all activities of the final macroprocesses of the Military 
Works System (SOM), at the executive, managerial and strategic levels.

This system is the first GRP (Government Resource Planning) developed in Brazil that was designed and developed totally oriented to geographical entities, 
in other words, all the modules are able to treat georeferenced information. All components (libraries, softwares, DBMS), used in the development of 
the solution are (*open source*).

The concepts that underpinned the development of the OPUS system are so advanced that it influenced several other projects in the Federal Government, 
giving a great visibility to the work of the Military Works Directorate (DOM/DEC).
