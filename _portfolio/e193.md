This was a critical project and very useful to the population, the call system E-193 of the Santa Catarina military fire brigade, at the time we started this project 
from the beginning and it was a very rewarding firing line to work and help save lives. This project was written in C++ with Qt part desktop and the backoffice 
made using PHP/Python with MySQL database and FreeBSD and Linux servers.
